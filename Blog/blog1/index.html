          <p class="fs-5 " >  Tetraodontidae
            is a Tetraodontiformes family of predominantly marine and estuary fish.
            Pufferfish, puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies,
            honey toads, sugar toads, and sea squab are all members of the family. Puffer fish are characterized
            by their enormous exterior spines (unlike the thinner, hidden spines of the Tetraodontidae, which are
            only visible when the fish have puffed up). The scientific name relates to the four massive teeth
            fused into an upper and lower plate that are used to shatter the hard shells of their natural food,
            crustaceans and mollusks.The majority of pufferfish species are deadly, and several are among the
            world's most dangerous vertebrates. Internal organs of certain species, such as the liver and
            occasionally the skin, contain tetrodotoxin, which is very harmful to most animals when consumed.</p>

          <p class="fs-5">Pufferfish are some of the oddest fish in the water, especially since they have a skeleton that is
            significantly reduced. They can form a ball out of their bodies without breaking any bones.
            They have fused skull and jaw bones in their head area.</p>

          <p class="fs-5">A young pufferfish's first set of teeth are set in a normal row along the jaw,the beak consists of
            paired upper and lower elements, each made up of a stack of elongated laminar teeth that consist
            almost entirely of enameloid and that are cemented together in a matrix of hard tissue. The individual
            teeth making up each element of the beak are members of the same tooth family, so that those at the
            cutting edge are older than those at the base. A cutting edge at the margin of the beak is maintained
            by differential wear of the tooth enameloid and of the surrounding bone. Tooth formation is
            intraosseous, so that as the teeth wear away at the cutting edge, the beak is replenished by addition of
            new teeth initiated and formed in a cavity at the base of the beak. Soon after the formation of an
            individual tooth is complete, hard tissue is laid down around it, to incorporate it into the beak. the
            teeth that replace them when they wear down are very different.</p>
          <p class="fs-5">Only a single replacement tooth forms in each quarter of the jaw. It elongates and eventually
            stretches across the entire jaw. New bands of replacement teeth then form underneath, in the jaw
            cavity. They make a stack that fuses together as the teeth grow, creating the beak. Stages of tooth
            development in a pufferfish, showing clockwise from top left: the change from teeth, to bands, to the
            beginnings of a beak. The teeth and bands are stained red. The unusual beak of the pufferfish is
            produced by small tweaks to the normal programme of tooth development.Most fish, unlike humans,
            produce new generations of teeth throughout their life. This requires a source of stem cells, which
            have the potential to develop into many different cell types and can be programmed to transform into
            the cells that build a tooth.</p>
          <p class="fs-5">The stem cells are usually located in the jaw, just below where the teeth will form. In the
            pufferfish, however, the stem cells are located outside of the jaw. Their access to the cavity in which
            the replacement teeth form is restricted to a single small opening in each quarter of the jaw.</p>
          <p class="fs-5">Stem cells are able to enter via these openings and move up through the jaw cavity to reach the
            four sites where the new teeth will grow.
            The beak, ideal for crunching through prey such as shellfish, is composed of elongated teeth that
            are fused together.</p>

          <p class="fs-5">They have spiky skin structures â€“ in certain patches around the body. These fish also lack some
            ribs and have no pelvis, allowing them to become globular shaped. Their skin is also adapted for
            stretching and the dermis layer contains lots of collagen fibres that allow it to expand by 40%. The
            spines of pufferfish composed of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite, protein(collagen), and water,
            the same materials as scales.Indeed, these spines are just modified scales. And like other scales,
            these spines originate during development from the mesoderm layer of the dermis or the skin. These
            spikes on their body are very poisonous, which are highly toxic to both animals and humans. Almost
            all species of puffer fish contain tetrodotoxin, which can be 1,200 times stronger than cyanide.</p>

              <h3> The following are the differences between typical bony fish and puffer fish:</h3>
              <ul class="fs-5 pt-2 p-5">
                <li class="p-3 ">Oceans are dominated by bony fish. They are distinguished from cartilaginous fish by having
                  bone skeletons and a swim bladder that allows them to float. Most bony fish species have
                  fusiform, hydrodynamic bodies that allow them to glide through the water at high speeds. Other
                  species have flat bodies and live at the sea's bottom. When frightened, puffer fish, for example,
                  inflate themselves to a globe many times their regular size by ingesting water.</li>
                <li class="p-3">The skeleton of a pufferfish lacks ribs and pelvic fins, and the skull and jaw have fused bones.
                  The lower complexity of the pufferfish Hox complexes is thought to be the cause of the
                  secondarily simplified pufferfish morphology. Bony Fish have two sets of ribs that connect to
                  the upper and lower regions of the vertebral arches but do not meet in the front. The ribs of
                  terrestrial vertebrates are thought to have originated from the top (dorsal) pair of ribs.</li>
                <li class="p-3">The skin of puffer fish is designed for stretching, and the dermis layer includes many collagen
                  fibers that allow it to extend by 40%. Other bony fish, unlike puffer fish, are unable to enlarge.</li>
                <li class="p-3">Pufferfish are the only bony fish that can close their eyes, and we've figured out how. They drop
                  their eyes deep into their sockets, then pucker the skin around their eyes together, as if sealing
                  the aperture of a camera.</li>
                <li class="p-3">There are no scales on puffer fish. They usually have spines instead. The spines of these
                  ordinarily lie flat, but as they puff up, they stand upright. Scales cover the majority of bony fish.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="container-xxl mt-5 mb-5">
              <div class="row justify-content-around align-items-center">
                   <div class="col-md-6" data-aos="fade-right">

          <p class="fs-5">The puffer fish, also known as blowfish, balloonfish, or bubblefish. They may expand to several
            times their normal size when assaulted by consuming water or air; porcupinefish, which have
            massive conspicuous spines, have a similar response (unlike the small, almost sandpaper-like spines
            of puffer fish). Tetraodon is named because its four huge teeth, which are fused into an upper and
            lower plate and utilized to break the shells of its native food, crus taceans and mollusks. Tetrodotoxin,
            a substance found in pufferfish, is a strong neurotoxin that may kill over 60% of humans who
            consume it. Although a human only needs a few milligrams of the poison to die, the flesh is
            nonetheless regarded as a delicacy in Japan and Korea.</p>
